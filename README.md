# Harmfull-animals-trap
An arduino system to trigger a cage. Some animals (like raccoons) are too smart to fall in a common trap. Therefore came the idea of making an electronic based trap.
## Disclaimer
Traps are not allowed in every countries.
## Fundamental principle
* The system is a really simple arduino based circuit using : 
  + 1 ultrasonic sensor
  + 1 servo motor
  + 1 RGB LED (optional)

When the animal will enter the cage, he will be in awarness mode. He wants to eat but he is affraid by the cage. The goal here is to let him enter the cage without anything happening.

The trap is triggered by the servo motor which will pull a fishing wire. This will release the trap's door.
